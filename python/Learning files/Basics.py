# Prints a line to the terminal (Also known as a String)
print("Hello World!")
# Parentheses and quotations are required for a string to work

# Python uses indentations in its code. This differs from other languages
# where the indentations dont actually affect the code at all. 

x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented with 4 spaces or a tab. VSCode will automatically apply
    # the indent for you.
    print("x is 1.")
